# Predicting Company Bankruptcy Using Financial Data

This repository contains the analysis and code for predicting the likelihood of company bankruptcy using financial data. The project leverages data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques.

## Abstract

- This project predicts the likelihood of company bankruptcy using financial data.
- The key objectives include:
  - Data preprocessing and handling missing values.
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand relationships.
  - Hypothesis testing to identify significant features.
- Machine learning techniques are applied for classification, focusing on Logistic Regression.
- Results provide actionable insights for financial risk management.

## Objective

To develop a predictive model to classify companies as bankrupt or non-bankrupt based on financial metrics. The goal is to provide actionable insights for financial risk management.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Understanding and Preprocessing**  
   - Loaded and inspected the dataset.  
   - Handled missing values and outliers.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Generated descriptive statistics.  
   - Visualized feature distributions and the target variable.  
   - Analyzed relationships between features and bankruptcy status.  

3. **Hypothesis Testing**  
   - Performed statistical tests to identify significant features impacting bankruptcy.  

4. **Feature Engineering and Selection**  
   - Created new features to enhance predictive power.  
   - Applied feature selection techniques like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE).  

5. **Modeling**  
   - Used Logistic Regression for classification.  
   - Evaluated performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  

6. **Model Interpretation and Insights**  
   - Interpreted model coefficients to understand feature impacts.  
   - Summarized insights and provided actionable recommendations.
